                             **Music Party**
______________________________________________________________________

MusicParty allows for peer-to-peer distribution of mp3 files through
use of a "tracker server." The music player gui uses a combination of 
tkinter and pygame so that peers can play the music via a list.  If a
song is added to a peers list, then all the other peers download that
song immediately, and can play it individually.
